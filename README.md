# Savvy-Note-Saver

## Description

This assignment introduces us to Express.js (Express), which, as defined, is considered the "de facto standard server framework for Node.js". It is used to build a more robust web app with backend functionality with a built-in Fetch API package.

In this work, the frontend was built and we connected Express in order to build the server side. Notes can be added and deleted.

WIP! Follow the progress below:

- [ ] GIVEN a note-taking application
- [x] WHEN I open the Note Taker
- [x] THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
- [x] WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
- [x] THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
- [x] WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
- [x] THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
- [x] WHEN I click on the Save icon
- [x] THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
- [x] WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
- [x] THEN that note appears in the right-hand column
- [x] WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page
- [x] THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column

BONUS functionality:

- [x] WHEN I click on the trash icon to the right of the note stored on the left menu
- [x] THEN that note is deleted from my notes list.
- [ ] Frontend should update dynamically.

REFACTOR

- [ ] Add comments where appropriate.
- [ ] Delete unnecessary lines.

## Installation

- This is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) application. It is recommended to use at least v16 (up to v18) for this app to run correctly.
- [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) is optional but is highly recommended while building and testing your server. Once in your project folder, type in `npm install nodemon`. When running your server, nodemon serves as a wrapper so instead of typing `node server.js` to run your server, instead type in `nodemon server.js`. Then every time your file is saved during that same work session, you do not need to restart your server as nodemon detects these changes for you.
- This was built on [Express](https://expressjs.com/). Once in your project folder, type in `npm install` to install the dependency listed in the `package.json` file.

### Additional Optional Resources

- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) is optional but highly recommended when testing out APIs.
