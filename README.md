# Savvy-Note-Saver

## Description

This assignment introduces us to Express.js (Express), which, as defined, is considered the "de facto standard server framework for Node.js". It is used to build a more robust web app with backend functionality with a built-in Fetch API package.

In this work, the frontend was built and we used Express in order to build the server side along with modular routing to organize our routes. The application was then deployed on Heroku.

## Installation

- This is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) application. It is recommended to use at least v16 (up to v18) for this app to run correctly.
- [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) is optional but is highly recommended while building and testing your server. Once in your project folder, type in `npm install nodemon`. When running your server, nodemon serves as a wrapper so instead of typing `node server.js` to run your server, instead type in `nodemon server.js`. Then every time your file is saved during that same work session, you do not need to restart your server as nodemon detects these changes for you.
- This was built on [Express](https://expressjs.com/). Once in your project folder, type in `npm install` to install the dependency listed in the `package.json` file.

### Additional Optional Resources

- [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) are optional tools but highly recommended when testing out API endpoints outside of the browser.

## Usage

- First, visit the live app [here](https://savvy-note-taker.herokuapp.com/).

- Click on the "Get Started" blue button. Once there, add notes by typing into the field and clicking the :floppy_disk: icon in the top right. Navigate through previous notes on the left and delete them by clicking on the :wastebasket: icon. This functionality is represented by the gif demo below:
